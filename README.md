# About perlin noise

Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise, in order to create a random landscape we need some random values for the z axis, but a totally random function is not enough. Perlin noise has a smooth transition between values, they are connected.
Here we can see a 2D image of Perlin noise.

The z axis is actually moving though a plane like this, using these values to create the landscape.
